# notion-proxy-ng
Turn your [Notion](https://notion.so "Notion") pages into a Website with your URLs and customizations. Faster than the previos version of [notion-proxy](https://github.com/equiposinoficina/notion-proxy "notion-proxy").

# Background
We have a project called [Industry 4.0 systems](https://industry40.systems "Industry 4.0 systems") where we publish technical information about Industry 4.0. It's really confortable write this information on [Notion](https://notion.so "Notion") and maintain our internal projects from there. We want to take in advantage our internal documentation system for publishing a web site with useful and public information.

So, this project is going to be a mechanism of publishing a useful web site using [Notion](https://notion.so "Notion") as a CMS (Content Management System).

# Schema
Project has three parts, 
- The **crawler**, which is going to download Notion pages as HTML static files.
- **get_slugs**, which will create a map for static HTML pages and pretty URLs.
- **OpenResty**, it works as an HTTP server and an application server which is going to serve the site assets.
